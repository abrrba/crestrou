Setting Up
##########

============
Introduction
============

We need to setup our machine properly so that we do not face issues at a later stage.

This chapter is the pre-requisite for the whole document to be completed successfully.

=====
Steps
=====

*   Download and install Ubuntu 16.04 LTS on a Virtual Machine.

*   Here are the output of the commands ``uname -a`` and ``cat /etc/lsb-release`` file.

::
    
    rishi@rishi-VirtualBox:~$ uname -a 
    Linux rishi-VirtualBox 4.4.0-24-generic #43-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 8 19:27:37 UTC 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

::

    rishi@rishi-VirtualBox:~$ cat /etc/lsb-release 
    DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
    DISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04
    DISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial
    DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 16.04 LTS"

=====================
Why a Virtual Machine
=====================

*   The machine where you will play should be a virtual machine so that your invalid setting to the
    kernel or any other configuration should not effect your base host machine. During this whole book
    you will write code which CAN end up shutting down the system or corrupting the system. This all
    can be avoided if you have a virtual machine to play on.

*   The virtual machine should have atleast 2 cores and 512 MB of RAM. This will make the kernel compilation fast.

*   Take a snapshot/clone of the machine once you are done with the installtion. This will enable
    you to revert your machine to the original state incase you mess up with it too
    badly.
