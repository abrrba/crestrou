Question 1
=========

Write a kernel module to see the list of the file systems supported by the kernel.

You can see the implementation of "cat /proc/filesystems" for your assignment.

Why this assignment
=================

This will enable you in understanding how the list of supported file systems
are maintained in the linux kernel and what happen's when a kernel module calls
"register_filesystem()".
