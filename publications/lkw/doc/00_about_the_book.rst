Introduction

Linux Kernel Programming is one of the most exciting thing for the beginners in
System Programming. With time a lot of excellent books were published on it but
the books were written to cover everything about the Linux Kernel and thus had
a widespread scope. These books enabled to a lot of people to take kernel
programming as their career chocices or as a hobby.

I have been seeing a lot of queries on the ``kernelnewbies`` mailing list where
people are requesting for the documents to start with. Most of them want to go
through a guided course or something. 

People (even I) generally suggest them the following books:

#.  The Design Of Unix Operating System
#.  Linux Kernel Development
#.  Understanding The Unix Kernel

For the learners who can't wait to get into code - I have written this small book.

This book is updated with the latest Ubuntu Desktop LTS releases. That means
that the book have the code which will meet the latest Ubuntu Desktop Releases.

This document will deal with the folowing topics.
    
* Compilation of Kernel
* Code Walkthrough using ``cscope`` and ``ctags``
* Kernel Modules
* Kernel Module Programming
* Proc Interface
* Data Strucutures available in the Kernel
* Character Device Drivers
* Other good stuff

The section has many ``Hands-On`` exercises which will enable you to learn
how to write code for kernel modules, and make changes to the linux kernel.
This section is very essential for getting a good feel of kernel
programming.

Happy Hacking !!
